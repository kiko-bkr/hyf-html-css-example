# hyf-html-css-example

Here is an example of a very simple approach to the HYF _html-css_ module's homework submission. Please note that this is by no means a guideline or a template, your submission can (and most probably should! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: ) look completely different from this simple page.

## My Aim

My aim is to just show you the basic structure of an HTML+CSS project, and to highlight the basic best practices. Within the files you will find a lot of comments, that will explain all of my thought processes and reasons for decisions. Mainly, I will show the ideal way to:

- Structure a project (where to put files etc.)
- Write **valid** HTML code.
- Use different kinds of CSS selectors to your advantage.
- Fix complex issues with `flexbox`.
