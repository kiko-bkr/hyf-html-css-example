What is this? This is an HTML comment. This text is not even noticed by HTML, it has no effect on the look of the page.
The only reason comments serve is to explain code to a person who did not write it. That person is you!

This is precisely why it is very important to comment your code if some part of it is a bit more complex,
and you want to save the time of the person who will work on your code next. Comments are our friends, let us use them.

So from now on I will comment all the different components and their purpose. 

In HTML, everything in between the characters < ! - - and - - > are considered as comments.

Note that if these comments were not here, the document would work just the same. If you want to take parts of 
this document, the comments are not necessary.

<!-- 
    Doctype? That stands for 'document type'. This tag is placed on top of every HTML page. Its purpose is to tell 
    the web browser that this file is in fact an HTML, and should be treated as such. Make sure to add it. 
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>


<!-- 
    The <html> tag should wrap your whole html document. It does not affect the look of your page. It is purely
    to organize your document better, and tell the browser the actual part of the document to pay attention to.  
    Again, do not forget to use it.

    Another important detail is to tell the internet browser what language your document is written in.
    This helps people who are searching for pages in Google in a specific language. The browser will know to not 
    consider your page if it is not written in the proper language.
-->
<html lang="en-us">


<!-- The <head> tag will contain all the necessary information about your document. Here we declare the following: -->
<head>

    <!-- This <meta> tag tells the browser what character encoding to use. You definitely do not have to know what
    a character encoding is, and I definitely will not explain it here haha. Make sure to add this. -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    
    <!-- Here we link a CSS file to this HTML file. Notice how we just put the file's name in the href property.
    That is because the file is in the same folder as our index.html file.

    <!-- The <title> tag is very important! It basically sets the name of the page, as in the name of the tab that

</head>

<!-- Now comes the body of the page. Here we actually start building the page, using elements that will actually
show up in the webpage. First and foremost, let us make sure that we structure this code using semantic elements. -->

<body>
    <!-- Ah! The <header> of the page. This is the first semantic element of the code. This element's name suggests That
    this element will act like a narrow strip of content at the top of the page, either as a decoration, a title,
    or as a helper in navigation. In my header all of these purposes are fulfilled.  -->
    <header>
        <!-- I want my header to look like this:
                - I want two rows
                    - The first one will contain the main heading of the page. I want this to be in the top left.
                        I want it to also contain the HYF logo, but that I want to be in the top right, so opposite
                        of the header. Thankfully, this can be done easily using flex.
                    - In the second row I want to have some navigation links that point to sections in the page.
                
            Now that I know this, I will accomplish it using flexbox:
                - the two rows have to be under each other, in a column, this is why in the styles.css file I set the
                  <header> element to be a flexbox, with flex-direction: column;
                - to make the rows actual rows, meaning their children elements are next to each other, I give the 
                  two <div> elements the class "header-row-div", since both of them have to have the same style, and this
                  way it is enough that I define the style only on the class, instead of on both elements
                - one more thing: I want that the first row puts its elements on the two ends, which I can do with
                the justify-content property of a flex container. I set this style on the id of the first row, that being
                "title-header-row-div"
        -->

        <div id="title-header-row-div" class="header-row-div">
            <h1>My Résumé</h1>
            <img id="hyf-logo-img" src="images/hyf.svg" alt="HYF Logo">
        </div>
        <div class="header-row-div">
            <!-- I refer to parts of the page using an <a> element, and referring to ids, like #education-section -->
            <a href="#education-section">Education</a>
            <a href="#projects-section">Projects</a>
            <a href="#volunteering-section">Volunteering</a>
        </div>
    </header>

    <!-- Now comes the main section -->

    <main>

        <!-- What I want to do in <main> is the opposite of what I wanted to do in <header>. I want two columns, one acting as 
        a sidebar, containing links to my contacts, and the other part would be the actual text section.

        So, again, I set that the big container (<main>) should be display: flex; (in styles.css) and this time
        the flex-direction should be row, as to make the columns stay next to each other horizontally. -->

        <!-- This is the sidebar. Here, I will link my fictional contacts. 
        The cool thing here is to see the <a> element's href attributes. Using custom links like "tel:" or "mailto:",
            clicking on these links immediately open a calling program, or an email program. Try clicking on them! -->
